# Finweb
This project collects bitcoin data from quandl and visualizes it. This program visualizes 5 graphs (2-years MA multiplier, 200-week ma, stock-to-flow, RSI, mining difficulty). This page is inspired by: `https://www.lookintobitcoin.com`


# How to run it
Just run `docker-compose up` and go to `http://localhost:1337`

# TODO:
1. add cron job
2. refactor
3. put some text on pages
4. add more graphs
5. add VIP graphs to only login users
